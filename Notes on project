ADD TO CART FUNCTION

when i hit add to cart I need to send the id to a page or modul
--then they select size and quantity and that stores in a cart page(which would have to hava a button that appears on the top of the page that says go to cart.
--the cart should add the order to their user profile or a table of invoices(this is better with a link to their user info)
add to current invoice ie invoice with id# that would be associated with the customer #

the page would have a check out option for when they are done or continue shopping option

would be associated with customer # or with session id

if customer (get shipping info from that)
otherwise ask for shipping info and billing would be through paypal api;

check out option
--take them to new page Checkout page
--this sets everything to be ready to insert into invoice table
--want to have remove option on the page, or maybe a chagne quantity option
--have them add shipping info here
--have them click checkout create the invoice
--they go to a new page where they signin to paypal
--then click approve at bottom, this is confirmation step, -- cancel gives them a popup modal that says confirm, or cancel
--popup modal that tells them success of order

-------invoice table

--user id(can be null), shipping address, products id, quantity, price, order date, unique invoice number, what they paid with
--what if not logged in, maybe user name instead of id.
